# cloud native microservices studies

### objective
What Cloud-Native microservices are, and how we can easily build with Spring Cloud.

### book
Hands On Microservices with Kotlin
- chapter 6 Creating Cloud-Native Microservices

### Spring Cloud Architecture

#### Configuration server:
- provides the capability to be queried about configurations, so when a microservice starts, it can retrieve all the 
values that need to be configured, such as URL, database connections, password, and anything that can be configured, from the Configuration Server

#### Service discovery: Eureka
- we use service discovery service to register or find instances of our microservice
obs: Heart-beat mechanism: a way for a microservice to tell a Service Discovery that it is available and ready to work

#### Load Balancer pattern: Ribbon
-  choose instances available among them to perform our request. this make an optimal usage of the instances, and split the load among them evenly.

#### Gateway pattern: Zuul
- is an entry point to our microservice, we expose them using a simple route and manage the details for them
obs: can also be used as the entry point to our security

#### Circuit breaker: Hystrix
- it's a way to deal with operations that can eventually fail. it has an open or closed status, telling us if the operation 
that encapsulates can be usedâ€”think of circuit breakers as fuses in an electrical installation.
